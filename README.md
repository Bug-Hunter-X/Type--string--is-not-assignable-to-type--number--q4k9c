This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.  The `bug.ts` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.ts` shows the corrected version.  This error highlights TypeScript's strength in static type checking, preventing runtime errors caused by incorrect argument types. The solution involves careful type handling and input validation to ensure that the function receives the expected type of arguments.
